<h1> 3D SHAPES </h3>

This is the very first program I've made with a GUI. I made this for a university assignment in the course "Application
Development Methologies". The main idea for this program is to give the user the choice to pick one out of four 3D shapes.
When the user has chosen, they have to insert the corresponding attributes and then its mass, its volume and its surface
area will appear on the screen. I hope you like this!

<h3> ! IMPORTANT!! </h3>
- Do not move anything that is in the files
- When the program runs, you will have to manually adjust the window size yourself or play with full screen. This is planned to be fixed.
- Do not delete any images included in the source files, for a better experience and a prettier GUI.
- Do NOT change the name of anything.

<h3> HOW TO RUN </h3>
For now and until I figure a way
to run more easily, I suggest you run this through a terminal/command line. Follow these steps:

for compilation:

'''
javac ./3DSHAPES/shapes/src/shapes/.*java
'''

to run:

'''
java ./3DSHAPES/shapes/src/shapes/ShapesForm
'''
